As you can see, this post is written in English. To improve my English expression ability, I decided to regularly write English posts, which will be extended to Japanese in the future.

Right, let's get down to business. **What did I do to improve myself lately?** It will include the following three parts.

- Physical and mental health
- Research
- Engineer

This post is the first part and will only include **Physical and mental health**.

# Physical and mental health

Before introducing what I did, let me explain why I choose to talk about this topic first.

After the internship, I needed to come back to school. I sincerely wish I could spend more time at Google, but due to the visa restriction, I couldn't (in Japan, foreign students can only work as full-time interns during vacation). Not only earning money, but another very important reason is also I don't have to deal with food by myself. Google has free cafeterias and all the things in the office are free! My understanding is it is a method Google trying to let employees focus on their work, but it does provide a very good experience to employees. Anyway, one thing I need to deal with is food.

Another thing is, I gradually became anxious about the future early this semester. I was worried about whether I could get a return offer and whether I could stay in Japan... I was also worried about the **research**. Yes, because my program is a research-based program (all programs in Japan are research-based), that means students need to do research and complete a thesis for graduation. I would have a weekly meeting with my supervisor from the beginning of this semester, but I didn't prepare anything about research back to that time.

Yeah, you may think things seem not good, and I agree with it. However, that's why I am going to record what I did. I am trying to avoid things getting worse.

## Physical health

### Food

Actually, I don't have a good way to deal with it, but I will update this page when I find a good solution. Probably it is because I haven't accepted the gap between the normal canteen and with cafeterias at Google. ^_^

I live in Odaiba (お台場), which is a sightseeing place but is far away from the central part of Tokyo (東京). Therefore, the prices of goods are not low and it is very inconvenient for commuting. If I go to school/laboratory where there is a canteen, the expense of commuting is too expensive (both money and time).

Now one of my solutions is to use canteens nearby, e.g. inside the Tokyo Teleport Center (東京テレポートセンター) and intake vitamins regularly.

### Posture

I gradually realized posture is one of my biggest problems which is accompanied me for a long time. Especially when walking, I always **hunchback** which looks **ugly**.

## Mental health
